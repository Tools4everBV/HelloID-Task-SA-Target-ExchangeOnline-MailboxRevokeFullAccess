## Description

This code snippet executes the following tasks:

1. Define a hash table `$formObject`. The keys of the hash table represent the properties of the room mailbox to be created, while the values represent the values entered in the form.

> To view an example of the form output, please refer to the JSON code pasted below.

```json
{
    "MailboxIdentity": "MySharedMailbox",
    "UsersToRemove": [
        {
            "Id": "84805b08-bc39-4fec-a79d-a4a6498dc7bz",
            "DisplayName": "JohnDoe"
        }
    ]
}
```

> :exclamation: It is important to note that the names of your form fields might differ. Ensure that the `$formObject` hashtable is appropriately adjusted to match your form fields. [See the Microsoft docs page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/remove-mailboxpermission?view=exchange-ps)
